        <h3>Utilizing HTML5</h3>
        <p>I know that I have learned how to clean up my code from taking this class. This lesson is just a great example of how structuring a layout is really easy with proper CSS and accompanying HTML code.</p>
        <p>Now, having said that, I did struggle with my previous assignment. As you may notice by examining the <span class="srCod">source code</span>, all the tags line up for all the pages, so IDK why the <span class="srCod">footer</span> keeps floating around like it does. Hopefully, that won't create an issue in your browser. My guess is that I have some static settings I'm unaware of.</p>
        <p>With all the stuggles, I am very happy with my progress and comprehension of material from the class. I have compiled a Resources list based on the lessons. Thanks so much.</p>

        <h3>Make it Easier?</h3>
        <p>Because I've a background in marketing, my suggestion is maybe use Google Slides as a tool to share the assignment links and relavent information. Sheets is OK but there just is no pazzazz ... and from a student perspective, it would be nice to have all the class assignment links together. Canvas does have modules, but its just not the same. But converting would be alot of work, and I dont want to suggest you spend time like that....</p>
        <p class="quote">Thanks so much for the class!</br>
