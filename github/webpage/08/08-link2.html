        <h3>Why these colors?</h3>
        <p>I chose the colors because I really like bold colors.</p>
        <p>I also like astonomy and space photography, so utilizing the stark contrast of bright colors on a black field is asthetic to me and actually helps me feel calm.</p>
        <p>When I think of how Nature mixes gas, minerals, gravity, and time to create every color and thing in the universe, I also have to keep in mind how those colors actually work togther in real life. Using the mix I chose, I think the colors work well together without creating any conflict in contrast, hue, or saturation to compliment each other.</p>
