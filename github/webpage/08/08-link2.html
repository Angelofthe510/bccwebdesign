        <h3>Lucille Ball</h3>
        <p>In early 1964, Roddenberry pitched a television series to Desilu Productions, calling it "a Wagon Train to the stars." Desilu studio head Lucille Ball was instrumental in approving production of the series. NBC paid to make the pilot "The Cage" and starred Jeffrey Hunter as Captain Christopher Pike. NBC rejected The Cage, but the executives were still impressed with the concept, and made the unusual decision to commission a second pilot: "Where No Man Has Gone Before".</p>
