        <h3>Lucille Ball</h3>
        <p>In early 1964, Roddenberry presented a brief treatment for a television series to Desilu Productions, calling it "a Wagon Train to the stars."[17] Desilu studio head Lucille Ball was instrumental in approving production of the series.[18] The studio worked with Roddenberry to develop the treatment into a script, which was then pitched to NBC.[19]</p>
        <p>NBC paid to make a pilot, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cage_(Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series)" target="_blank">"The Cage"</a>, starring Jeffrey Hunter as Enterprise Captain Christopher Pike. NBC rejected The Cage, but the executives were still impressed with the concept, and made the unusual decision to commission a second pilot: "Where No Man Has Gone Before".[19]</p>
