      <h3>WW2 & Star Trek</h3>
      <p>Roddenberry and Jefferies had something in common: they both flew B-17's in WWII â€” Matt in Europe, Gene in the Pacific. "So when he came in [to meet each other], why, we re-fought WWII for about 20 minutes," Jefferies related in a 2001 video interview, "and then he told me what he wanted [the ship to look like]." Actually, his main requirements were several "don'ts": "No flames, no fins, no rockets." And only one "do": "Make it look like it's got power. And he walked out."</p>
