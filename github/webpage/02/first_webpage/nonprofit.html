    <title>Non Profit Example</title>
    <h1>Non Profit Example</h1>
    <p>I volunteered at an NPO for about 5 years. Our group organized a successful campaign to pass Measure BB which gave students in Alameda county under 18 a free transit pass and restored routes to marginalized neighborhoods. I created a few documents to support the cause, but my primary contribution was assisting in conducting various town hall meetings and sitting on the Leadership Council.</p>
