    <title>Corporate Example</title>
    <h1>Long Beach Port</h1>
    <p>One project Iâ€™m proud of from a corporate perspective was working with the Port of Long Beach. I was the graphic designer on the team of 5 people that created the pitch that sold the software solution designed to efficiently regulate truck traffic through the port to reduce pollutants from idling trucks.</p>
