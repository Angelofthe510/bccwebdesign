<h1>My First H1 Heading</h1>
<h2>My First H2 Heading</h2>
<p>My first paragraph. Deflector power at maximum. Energy discharge in six seconds. Warp reactor core primary coolant failure. Fluctuate phaser resonance frequencies. Resistance is futile. Recommend we adjust shield harmonics to the upper EM band when proceeding. These appear to be some kind of power-wave-guide conduits which allow them to work collectively as they perform ship functions. Increase deflector modulation to upper frequency band.</p>

<p>Text can go in here. Maybe a list:
    <ul>
    <li>USS Yamato - NCC-71807 - Crew discovered Iconian artifacts but is infected by a computer virus that causes antimatter containment loss. The virus causes the ship to explode with all hands lost.</li>
    <li>ISS Enterprise - NX-01 - The Mirror Universe version of the NX-01; appeared in the fourth season two-parter, "In a Mirror, Darkly".</li>
    <li>USS Defiant - NCC-1764 - Taken to Mirror Universe by Tholians, in "The Tholian Web". Captured by crew of ISS Enterprise (NX-01) and used in service of the Terran Empire, in "In a Mirror, Darkly".</li>
    </ul>

<p>Deflector power at maximum. Energy discharge in six seconds. Warp reactor core primary coolant failure. Fluctuate phaser resonance frequencies. Resistance is futile.

These appear to be some kind of power-wave-guide conduits which allow them to work collectively as they perform ship functions. Increase deflector modulation to upper frequency band.</p>
<p>Sensors indicate human life forms 30 meters below the planet's surface. Stellar flares are increasing in magnitude and frequency. Set course for Rhomboid Dronegar 006, warp seven. There's no evidence of an advanced communication network. Total guidance system failure, with less than 24 hours' reserve power. Shield effectiveness has been reduced 12 percent. We have covered the area in a spherical pattern which a ship without warp drive could cross in the given time.</p>
<p>It indicates a synchronic distortion in the areas emanating triolic waves. The cerebellum, the cerebral cortex, the brain stem,  the entire nervous system has been depleted of electrochemical energy. Any device like that would produce high levels of triolic waves. These walls have undergone some kind of selective molecular polarization. I haven't determined if our phaser energy can generate a stable field. We could alter the photons with phase discriminators.</p>
<p footer>Sensors indicate no shuttle or other ships in this sector. According to coordinates, we have travelled 7,000 light years and are located near the system J-25. Tractor beam released, sir. Force field maintaining our hull integrity. Damage report? Sections 27, 28 and 29 on decks four, five and six destroyed. Without our shields, at this range it is probable a photon detonation could destroy the Enterprise.</p>
