    <div id="movBox2">
      <h4>Static</h4>
      <p>Static is the default value, all elements will be static unless specified otherwise. This means the element is not placed and will adjust within the flow of the natural linear positioning on the webpage.</p>
      <div>
        <span class="whiteBox2">This is a default box.</span>
      </div>
      <p></p>
      <div class="posStatic">
        <span class="whiteBox2">This one is static - there is no difference!</span>
      </div>
      <p></p>
      <hr>
      <h4>Fixed Position</h4>
      <p id="posStatic">An element can be fixed – it is fixed in one place and will not move regardless of any screen scrolling. It is commonly used for menus that stay at the top of a page when scrolling down a page. The element is taken out its normal flow and the space filled by the surrounding elements. It’s position is specified in relation to the viewport – the fancy name for the content area of your browsers!</p>
      <p id="posFix" class="whiteBox3">This text is fixed in place. Scroll and it does not move.</p>
      <p id="whiteBox3">Unidentified vessel travelling at sub warp speed, bearing 235.7. Fluctuations in energy readings from it, Captain. All transporters off. A strange set-up, but I'd say the graviton generator is depolarized. The dark colourings of the scrapes are the leavings of natural rubber, a type of non-conductive sole used by researchers experimenting with electricity. The molecules must have been partly de-phased by the anyon beam.</p>
      <p>It indicates a synchronic distortion in the areas emanating triolic waves. The cerebellum, the cerebral cortex, the brain stem, the entire nervous system has been depleted of electrochemical energy. Any device like that would produce high levels of triolic waves. These walls have undergone some kind of selective molecular polarization. I haven't determined if our phaser energy can generate a stable field. We could alter the photons with phase discriminators.</p>
      <p>Sensors indicate no shuttle or other ships in this sector. According to coordinates, we have travelled 7,000 light years and are located near the system J-25. Tractor beam released, sir. Force field maintaining our hull integrity. Damage report? Sections 27, 28 and 29 on decks four, five and six destroyed. Without our shields, at this range it is probable a photon detonation could destroy the Enterprise.</p>
      <h4>Relative Position</h4>
      <p>An element can be <b>fixed</b> in one place and will not move regardless of any screen scrolling. It is commonly used for menus that stay at the top of a page when scrolling down a page. The element is taken out its normal flow and the space filled by the surrounding elements. It’s position is specified in relation to the viewport – the fancy name for the content area of your browsers! </p>

      <h4>Relative Position + Z Index</h4>
      <p>As can be seen, elements will overlap if they are moved into the space of another. Elements are displayed in the order that they are written in your html. You can manipulate this by specifying a ‘z-index’. The default is zero, so giving the first element a higher z-index will make it appear on top instead:</p>
      <p id="whiteBox4">This div tag is static</p>
      <p id="relativeTop">
        <span class="whiteBox4">This div is moved 25px <em>from the top</em> of it's <em>normal</em> position </span>.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="relativeLeft">
        <span class="whiteBox4">This div tag is moved 40px <em>to the left</em> of it's <em>normal position</em>. </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h4>Absolute Position</h4>
      <h3 id="h3_PP"><span class="hiLite">This is the H3 tag --></span> A Boring Headline </h3>
      <p id="moveBox1">This is some text to add to the experiment. It really does not matter what it says, as long as there is a bunch of letters strung together and look like there is something you would actuall;y want to read. I guess I could have picked up more of the Star Trek Ipsum, but what the heck, this is just me raandomly typing because I can!!</p>
