    <h2>Extra Credit</h2>
    <h3>Online Help</h3>
    <p>IDK how to share my browser history with you, but I have been using W3Schools as my first stop for answers on how to code something. Even for the simpler stuff I do, I seem to always need an answer about something. My second stop is YouTube. I can share my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm-IK9dY-I-0_3rPUUPxKYA" target="_blank">my YouTube Channel</a> and you can see I do A LOT of tutorials and subscribe to creatives who share techniques. Heres a quick <a href="screen01.png" target="_blank">screenshot</a> of my recent history.</p>
    <h3>Organizing Environment</h3>
    <p>I will say that after hearing your views on desktop management, I implemented a new regiment on my new MacStudio - No more desktop clutter. I store stuff either in folders on my HD and secure storage and backup to two Seagate drives. Infact, I ended up spending a whole night reorganizing both my laptop and setting up my MacStudio.</p>
    <h3>Block Out Time</h3>
    <p>I am doing my best to manage my time, however I have a disabled sister and she recently switched in-home care providers so my schedule is in more flux than I expected when I signed up for class. I will do my best to keep up.</p>
    <h3>Organizing Files and Visual Studio Code + Github</h3>
    <p>Visual Studio is great and I love working with it and GitHub. Its really very easy to get going and keep up with it. I created a folder on my iCloud so I can access the web projects I'm working on easier. Here is <a href="shot02.png" target="_blank">a screenshot of Github account</a> and <a href="shot03.png" target="_blank">a shot of the <span class="source">dev</span> window</a> and I really enjoy using it.</p>
