        Madness has no purpose. Or reason. But it may have a goal. It's time you learned that freedom is never a gift. It has to be earned. You know the greatest danger facing us is ourselves, and irrational fear of the unknown. There is no such thing as the unknown. Only things temporarily hidden, temporarily not understood. Do you know the old Klingon proverb that revenge is a dish best served cold? It is very cold — in space. No, Kirk, no. You’ll not escape. From hell’s heart, I stab at thee. …For spite’s sake, I spit my last breath at thee. You may find that having is not so pleasing a thing as wanting. This is not logical, but it is often true. Improve a mechanical device and you may double productivity. But improve man, you gain a thousandfold. Instruments register only through things they're designed to register. Space still contains infinite unknowns. Khaaannnn! …Warp speed. I’ve done far worse than kill you. …I’ve hurt you; and I intend to go on… hurting you. I will leave you as you left me; as you left her. Marooned for all eternity at the center of a dead planet. …Buried alive; buried alive….
