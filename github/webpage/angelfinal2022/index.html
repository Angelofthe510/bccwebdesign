But Alice did not; she was on her own in a very strange place, but she kept on going and followed her curiosity â€“ "that's the White Rabbit". A lot of women could have taken a message from that story about how you can push your own agenda. The line "feed your head" is about reading, as well as psychedelics feed your head by paying attention: read some books, pay attention."</p>

          <p>Today, most people know the song <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Rabbit_(song)" target="_blank">"White Rabbit"</a> from "The Matrix" movies. Grace Slick started writing that song in  1967 when she was with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Society_(band)" target="0_blank"> The Great Society</a>.</p>
          <p>Ironically, the band played the nightclub <a href="http://rockprosopography101.blogspot.com/2021/01/the-matrix-3138-fillmore-st-san.html" target="_blank">"The Matrix"</a> in San Francisco.</p>

          <h2>A Simple Final Project<br>
          </h2>
          <h5>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fall 2022 </h5>
          <div class="backgroundcolor">
            <p>This semester, I took <span class="mainImg3"><a href="#">MMDI 4 Intro to Photoshop</a></span>, <span class="mainImg3"><a href="#">MMVI 20A Intro to Video Editing</a></span>, and <span class="mainImg3"><a href="#">MMWW 1A Intro to Web Design</a></span>. I also signed up for the free <span class="mainImg3"><a href="#">MMDI 515A Intro to C4D</a></span> class.</p>
            <p>I've taken Motion Graphics, Game Design, Intro to MultiMedia, Script Writing, and Intro to Video Production at BCC. With all the classes, we have blended assets from Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, original footage and audio, and stock video and audio into various projects.</p>
            <p>Once I started getting going in my classes, I became excited about all the different techniques that I would learn. While going through the first few weeks of classes, I began to think about how I could incorporate projects between classes. My first collaboration was with the Sugar Poster. Using the Team Project from C4D, I was able to create a poster from the final shot of our C4D video.</p>
            <p>The next project sorta fell out of the sky. A Split Screen for Intro to Video soon became a short video to show the differences between how two textures in C4D render during animation. The Final Project for Intro to Photoshop seemed like an easy thing to pull off. All I needed was a subject.</p>
            <p>One day diving down a rabbit hole on the internet, I came across a story about how Jefferson Starship had regrouped and recorded new material, but of course the first footage I saw was the new JS performing White Rabbit. I decided that my final for Video Editing would be a mash-up of the old WR playig along with the new WR.</p>
            <p>The Final Project developed into a crossover with C4D, Photoshop, Illustrator, Premier, and After Effects to create promotional material for a music group.

          <h2>C4D: The Pills</h2>
          <p class="text-left">For the video, I created two backdrops for the pills, one motif is just the Red and Blue pills, the other motif is the Yellow, Lt Blue, Red and Blue pills.</p>
          <p class="text-left">First, I set up the C4D file to match the file size of output. Next, I created the two pills, the textures, camera, and lights then began experimenting with the settings to get a look I liked.</p>
          <p class="text-left">Whats cool about this, is that all the elements are editable so I was able to twist, turn and position the pill clusters where I wanted. Each screensize required a slightly different placement of elements, so I created three files for eachy size.</p>
          <p class="text-left">Once the file was created, I exported each frame as a seperate Photoshop document. I then was able to edit the opacity of the background.</p>
          <p class="text-left">I used multiple files for the pills. One file was just for the animation. It was set to the screensize of the video then rendered to a video that was then imported into the Premier project.</p>
          <p class="text-left">I also had made the "My Turntable" movie on my own during the summer break. Using the techniques learned in the MMDI 15A class I made the turntalbe movie just for fun. I thought I would try and use it for this project, but it was cut during the review process. No big deal though, I like the end result much better.</p>
          <p class="text-left"><a href="https://youtu.be/W9lAL3X-q_4" target="_blank">MMDI 15A</a> with Michel Bobhot is the class to teach you all these great skills to make all kinds of objects which can be used in Photoshop.</p>

            <p class="text-left">My <a href="#">MMVI 9A</a> class was all about video editing. Premier is full of so many really cool tools. Last semester in MMVI 9A - Intro to Video Production, we where introduced to Premier. MMVI 20A was all about exploring what Premier can do.</p>
            <p class="text-left">Last semester, I used Illustrator to create the tile for my <a href="https://youtu.be/RYPHdlo79iQ">final video project</a>. That short lesson about importing Photoshop or Illustrator into Premier opened up yet one more internet rabbit hole for me to go down.</p>
            <p class="text-left">This panel doesnt really show the full library, but I used After Effects to create the floating masks and ending sequence of the video.</p>
            <p class="text-left">
              The TA for video editing suggested using After Effects for masking and the ending sequence. She said "Premier is good for somethings, but After Effects is better for alot of things."
