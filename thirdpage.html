    <p>IMHO, Bob Ross was the father of YouTube tutorials. Sure there where others before him, but he made it OK to watch guided meditation videos. If you have a digital TV antenna, you can watch the 24/7 Bob Ross channel. They have commercials, but about 98% of the original program is still there!!</p>
